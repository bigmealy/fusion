    "question": "How long do you take to set up?",
    "answer": "We need an hour to set up, check everything is working and do a quick sound check. We therefore arrive at the venue at least an hour before we start playing."

  {
    "question": "What time do you start, and how long do you perform for?",
    "answer": "For a standard wedding/function booking we will play up to 4 hours (which includes a half hour break), and the start time is typically 8pm or 8:30pm. However, no two bookings are exactly the same so weâ€™ll be sure to discuss schedule with you."
